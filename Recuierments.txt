Dear Student,

You are required to prepare a short "Project Requirements Document".
Please prepare one by 24.11.17 and submit it to me  by e-mail.
An example of such a document can be found in our web site in the following
location :

http://www.ee.technion.ac.il/labs/vlsi/Upload/Administration/PrjReqTemplate.doc

Please note that this is simply a template and you should prepare a similar
document that suits your particular project.

- You can choose to write it in Hebrew if you please.
- You must adapt the example to suit your particular project.
- You can elaborate on any section you please.

Pls co-ordinate this with your partner and supervisor.

Thank you and best regards,

Goel.
